Difficulty   ---> Medium

A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people.  A square matrix mat is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexing.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[0 1 0],
                [0 0 0], 
                [0 1 0]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. 
Input: mat[][] = [[0 1],
                [1 0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The two people at the party both know each other. None of them is a celebrity.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= mat.size()<= 3000
0 <= mat[i][j]<= 1
